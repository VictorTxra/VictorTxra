# About me

### Graduated in Digital Games, but since the second semester I started an internship as a web designer, which later led me to pursue a career as a front-end developer.
### I took courses and increasingly improved my professional skills. Throughout the work I also developed interpersonal skills, time management, agile scrum and using tools to improve the performance of my work.
### In addition to working for companies, I also develop websites for third parties through my micro-company, Kimera Company.
## Contact me through my website, Instagram, LinkedIn or Discord to find out more about me.
